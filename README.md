The core of this subject is to stress on CSS. We aren't allowed to use any JavaScript for interaction and have to find alternatives for those interactions.

The goals for this subject is as following:

- Experiment with CSS-techniques that are new for you.
- Know the full extent of CSS, that CSS is not just for styling.
- Understanding of the interaction techniques from CSS (and HTML). UX is humane within the chosen context(s).
- Progressive enhancement is elegantly applied. You can show how cascase, inheritance and specificity works.

There are two restrictions in this course:

1. Don't use `id="id"` or `class="class"`. The reason for this restriction is so we practice with the CSS selectors.
   - The caveat for this restriction is the `:target` selector which requires an ID.
   - If you don't see a way out without ID's or classes, follow the following steps:
     - Google it
     - Ask students
     - Ask teachers
     - Use class or ID.
1. Don't use JavaScript. If you plan to use interaction which isn't achievable by using CSS, scrap that interaction.
